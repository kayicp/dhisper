# Dhisper

**Dhisper** is a decentralized message board protocol built on the Internet Computer, designed to support thread-based discussions with fine-grained ownership, authorization, and metadata control. Its primary functionality allows users to create threads, post replies, query content, and manage ownership or authorization; all on-chain.

Posts and threads can be paginated, queried by timestamp or bump order, and selectively deleted by their owners. Itâ€™s built for communities that need both openness and access control.

A live demo is available at: [Dhisper's frontend canister](https://loxja-3yaaa-aaaan-qz3ha-cai.icp0.io/)

> ðŸ“¸ Screenshots and demo videos coming soon.

## Introduction

Dhisper is a decentralized discussion engine for open communities, forums, and apps that require trustless ownership of user content. It supports creation and deletion of posts, full authorization control, and efficient paginated queries; all stored immutably on-chain.

Highlights:

* **Decentralized Ownership**: Each post or reply has identity-based ownership with optional subaccount support.
* **Structured Threads & Replies**: Supports nested threads with max-size constraints, timestamps, and bump tracking.
* **Fine-Grained Deletion**: Posts can be deleted only by thread or post owners under defined rules.
* **Batch Queries**: Optimized endpoints allow bulk-fetching timestamps, owners, and authorizations for frontend efficiency.
* **Metadata-Driven Limits**: Max replies, threads, pagination sizes are configurable through metadata values.

Hereâ€™s an example of the systemâ€™s architectural flow:

## Installation
Step-by-step guide to get a copy of the project up and running locally for development and testing.

### Install
A step-by-step guide to installing the project, including necessary configuration etc.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:kayicp/dhisper.git
$ cd dhisper
$ npm install
$ bash deploy-local.sh
```

## Usage
Start [here](https://loxja-3yaaa-aaaan-qz3ha-cai.icp0.io/).

One can browse the threads and read their replies without signing in. To scroll the threads, use the mouse-scrollwheel or the slide/swipe touch gesture.

Only interactions such as Creating a Post, Deleting a Post, Withdrawing Balance, and Revoking Token Approval, require signing in via Internet Identity.
